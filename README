OLA rpi3 image builder.

This script builds an OLA image for Rapsberry Pi 3.

Basically it downloads the latests raspbian lite image, clones the OLA repo and
sets everything up so that OLA gets compiled on first boot.

#############################################################################
This script is configured to overclock the rpi3, be careful, use a heatsink.
(or modify the include /boot/config.txt , /etc/rc.local and
/etc/rc.local.final to disable overclocking)
##############################################################################

Once you have executed the script, you will have a zip file containing the image and the md5 checksum.
if you want to put the image on your rpi, first unzip it, then check the md5sum :

$ unzip ola-rpi3.zip
$ md5sum -c ola-rpi3.md5

To flash the image, you should probably do something like that :
dd if=ola-rpi3.img of=/dev/SDCARD bs=4M

Your rpi needs to be connected to the internet on its first boot since the system gets automatically updated before compiling OLA.

Compilation takes about an hour, the rpi3 reboots automatically when it's done and OLA should be working.

A good thing to do when you have a working OLA on your rpi is to backup the sd card, useful if you encounter problems such as filesystem
corruption due to power loss, or if you want to quickly have another ola node on another rpi, without having to wait an hour:

dd if=/dev/SDCARD of=/home/ola-backup.img bs=4M
