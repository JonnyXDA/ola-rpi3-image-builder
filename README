OLA rpi3 image builder.

This is a set of scripts used to build OLA images for Raspberry Pi 3. There are
multiple scripts depending on what you want to achieve.

In the directory 'ola_git_image', you will find a script to create an image.
OLA will be compiled by the rpi3 automatically on first boot.
In the directory 'ola_crosscompile_debian_x64', you will find a script to create
an image, same as before, but OLA will be cross compiled when building the image
and it will be ready to use. not working at the moment.
Other cross compile directories will be added when the first one is ok.
